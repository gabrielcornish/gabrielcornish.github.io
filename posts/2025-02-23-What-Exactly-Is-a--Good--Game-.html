      <p>I&#39;ve always struggled with the desire to make something that is considered &quot;good&quot;—and to do it consistently.</p>
<p>The problem is, &quot;good&quot; is subjective.</p>
<p>This led me to discover one of my toxic traits: I want the subjective to become objective. I&#39;m always searching for a reproducible and systematic approach to the creative process. I like things to be clear and straightforward.</p>
<p>It&#39;s flawed thinking, but I believed that if I could define what a good game was, then I could deconstruct the process and make one consistently.</p>
<p>A definition eluded me for a long time, but I eventually stumbled upon one that I feel good about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A game is only as good as the promises it keeps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I came across this idea in one of the best blog posts I’ve read on game creation: </p>
<p><a href="https://farawaytimes.blogspot.com/2023/02/how-to-make-good-small-games.html">How to Make Good Small Games.</a></p>
<p>After reading it, I realized that a game gets to define its own terms of success. It does this by making promises to the player—and then keeping them.</p>
<p>A game should be judged by how well it keeps its promises. Does it deliver what it says it will?</p>
<p>Making a game that costs half a billion dollars and takes ten years to develop is a type of promise with high expectations. It’s a hard promise to keep. Alternatively, a 5-minute game with amateur art can still be good as long as it delivers on its promises—a much easier promise to keep.</p>
<p>So, I think I’ve found a good balance between a subjective and objective definition of what makes a good game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A good game keeps its promises to the player.</p>
