    <title>What Exactly Is a "Good" Game?</title>
    <description>
<![CDATA[<p>I&#39;ve always struggled with the desire to make something that is considered &quot;good&quot;‚Äîand to do it consistently.</p>
<p>The problem is, &quot;good&quot; is subjective.</p>
<p>This led me to discover one of my toxic traits: I want the subjective to become objective. I&#39;m always searching for a reproducible and systematic approach to the creative process. I like things to be clear and straightforward.</p>
<p>It&#39;s flawed thinking, but I believed that if I could define what a good game was, then I could deconstruct the process and make one consistently.</p>
<p>A definition eluded me for a long time, but I eventually stumbled upon one that I feel good about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A game is only as good as the promises it keeps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I came across this idea in one of the best blog posts I‚Äôve read on game creation: </p>
<p><a href="https://farawaytimes.blogspot.com/2023/02/how-to-make-good-small-games.html">How to Make Good Small Games.</a></p>
<p>After reading it, I realized that a game gets to define its own terms of success. It does this by making promises to the player‚Äîand then keeping them.</p>
<p>A game should be judged by how well it keeps its promises. Does it deliver what it says it will?</p>
<p>Making a game that costs half a billion dollars and takes ten years to develop is a type of promise with high expectations. It‚Äôs a hard promise to keep. Alternatively, a 5-minute game with amateur art can still be good as long as it delivers on its promises‚Äîa much easier promise to keep.</p>
<p>So, I think I‚Äôve found a good balance between a subjective and objective definition of what makes a good game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A good game keeps its promises to the player.</p>
</blockquote>

    <title>A Daily Routine For Unemployed Game Devs</title>
    <description>
<![CDATA[<p>üïπ Unemployed as a game developer? Here's how I'm staying on track and keeping my spirits up.</p>
<p>I've crafted a simple daily routine that's been essential for my mental well-being and productivity during this period.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mornings: Create üé®</li>
<li>Mid-days: Connect üì®</li>
<li>Afternoons: ‚ÄãContribute üôåüèΩ</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../images/unemployed-routine.jpg" alt="Unemployed Routine"></p>
<p><strong>CREATE</strong>: This is all about building skills and creative growth.</p>
<p>While the timing of my next opportunity is uncertain, I'm making the most of this time by exploring new technologies, building games, and honing my craft.</p>
<p><strong>CONNECT</strong>: This phase is all about maximizing opportunities.</p>
<p>Whether it's reaching out to my network, applying for roles, or sharing my latest work, I'm just trying to keep the momentum going.</p>
<p><strong>CONTRIBUTE</strong>: Giving back to the community is key.</p>
<p>Whether it's helping others in their job search, collaborating on indie projects, or participating in game jams, assisting others is how we're all going to get through this.</p>
<p>üåü And here's one last bonus...</p>
<p><strong>EVENINGS</strong>: Community‚Äã Evenings are dedicated to recharging with loved ones. It's my time to unplug, rest, and cherish moments with friends and family.</p>
<p>I'd love to hear what strategies have been working for you as you navigate your job search.</p>]]>
