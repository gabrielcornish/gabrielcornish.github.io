<![CDATA[<p>üïπÔ∏è Game design isn&#39;t that complicated.</p>
<p>Players just need 4 things in order to have fun: </p>
<p>Purpose, motivation, agency, and clarity.</p>
<p>If a game isn&#39;t fun, one of those elements is lacking.</p>]]>

    <title>I'm making a game about exploring a small mall</title>
    <description>
<![CDATA[<p>Can I make my first Steam game in one year?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve always wanted to.</p>
<p>So, this year I started making a game about exploring a mall. In the game you buy gifts for friends, discover secrets, and meet other quirky shoppers.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve worked in the game industry for over 10 years, but I&#39;ve never released a Steam game on my own. It&#39;s been on my bucket list for a while, but never quite had the confidence to do it.</p>
<p>In some ways, I still don&#39;t.</p>
<p>Well, this year I chose to take a crack at it.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not one of those indies who&#39;s trying to strike it rich or make my &quot;dream&quot; game. Gambling in Las Vegas would be a more efficient way to make money.</p>
<p>No, I just want to make something that is worth charging for.</p>
<p>A game that&#39;s small, focused, and delivers a fun experience worth the asking price.</p>
<p>I want to <a href="https://gabrielcornish.com/posts/2025-02-23-What-Exactly-Is-a--Good--Game-.html">make small promises to my players</a>, and then fulfill them. Plus a little extra.</p>
<p>Nothing more. Nothing less.</p>
<p>I started prototyping the game in January and hope to release in January 2026.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll let you know how it goes.</p>

    <title>What Exactly Is a "Good" Game?</title>
    <description>
<![CDATA[<p>I&#39;ve always struggled with the desire to make something that is considered &quot;good&quot;‚Äîand to do it consistently.</p>
<p>The problem is, &quot;good&quot; is subjective.</p>
<p>This led me to discover one of my toxic traits: I want the subjective to become objective. I&#39;m always searching for a reproducible and systematic approach to the creative process. I like things to be clear and straightforward.</p>
<p>It&#39;s flawed thinking, but I believed that if I could define what a good game was, then I could deconstruct the process and make one consistently.</p>
<p>A definition eluded me for a long time, but I eventually stumbled upon one that I feel good about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A game is only as good as the promises it keeps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I came across this idea in one of the best blog posts I‚Äôve read on game creation: </p>
<p><a href="https://farawaytimes.blogspot.com/2023/02/how-to-make-good-small-games.html">How to Make Good Small Games.</a></p>
<p>After reading it, I realized that a game gets to define its own terms of success. It does this by making promises to the player‚Äîand then keeping them.</p>
<p>A game should be judged by how well it keeps its promises. Does it deliver what it says it will?</p>
<p>Making a game that costs half a billion dollars and takes ten years to develop is a type of promise with high expectations. It‚Äôs a hard promise to keep. Alternatively, a 5-minute game with amateur art can still be good as long as it delivers on its promises‚Äîa much easier promise to keep.</p>
<p>So, I think I‚Äôve found a good balance between a subjective and objective definition of what makes a good game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A good game keeps its promises to the player.</p>
</blockquote>

    <title>A Daily Routine For Unemployed Game Devs</title>
    <description>
<![CDATA[<p>üïπ Unemployed as a game developer? Here's how I'm staying on track and keeping my spirits up.</p>
<p>I've crafted a simple daily routine that's been essential for my mental well-being and productivity during this period.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mornings: Create üé®</li>
<li>Mid-days: Connect üì®</li>
<li>Afternoons: ‚ÄãContribute üôåüèΩ</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../images/unemployed-routine.jpg" alt="Unemployed Routine"></p>
<p><strong>CREATE</strong>: This is all about building skills and creative growth.</p>
<p>While the timing of my next opportunity is uncertain, I'm making the most of this time by exploring new technologies, building games, and honing my craft.</p>
<p><strong>CONNECT</strong>: This phase is all about maximizing opportunities.</p>
<p>Whether it's reaching out to my network, applying for roles, or sharing my latest work, I'm just trying to keep the momentum going.</p>
<p><strong>CONTRIBUTE</strong>: Giving back to the community is key.</p>
<p>Whether it's helping others in their job search, collaborating on indie projects, or participating in game jams, assisting others is how we're all going to get through this.</p>
<p>üåü And here's one last bonus...</p>
<p><strong>EVENINGS</strong>: Community‚Äã Evenings are dedicated to recharging with loved ones. It's my time to unplug, rest, and cherish moments with friends and family.</p>
<p>I'd love to hear what strategies have been working for you as you navigate your job search.</p>]]>
